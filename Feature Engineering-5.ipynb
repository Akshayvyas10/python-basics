This assumes that the categories have a meaningful order or hierarchy.\nWhen to use: When the categories have a clear ordinal relationship (e.g., \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\").\nExample: For a survey question with responses \"Strongly Disagree\", \"Disagree\", \"Neutral\", \"Agree\", \"Strongly Agree\", ordinal encoding would assign values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.\n\nLabel Encoding:\n\nApproach: Assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order.\nWhen to use: When the categories do not have a clear ordinal relationship (e.g., \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\").\nExample: For a categorical variable representing colors, label encoding might assign values like 1, 2, 3 to \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", respectively.\n\nChoosing between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n\nOrdinal Relationship: If there's a clear ordinal relationship between the categories, ordinal encoding is preferable as it preserves the order information.\nNo Ordinal Relationship: If there's no clear order, label encoding is appropriate as it treats all categories equally.\nMachine Learning Algorithm: Some algorithms (like decision trees) can handle categorical data directly, while others (like linear regression) require numerical data.\nIn the latter case, label encoding or ordinal encoding is necessary.\n\nExample:\nConsider a dataset about car sales. If you have a categorical variable \"Car Color\" with values \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Black\", \nlabel encoding would be suitable as there's no inherent order among colors. However, if you have a categorical variable \"Car Size\" with values \n\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\", ordinal encoding would be more appropriate as there's a clear order of sizes.'''",

Unlike traditional ordinal encoding, which assigns numerical values based on a predefined order, target guided ordinal encoding leverages the target variable to determine the order of categories.   \n\nHow it works:\n\nCalculate the mean of the target variable: For each category of the categorical variable, calculate the mean value of the target variable.\nSort categories based on mean target values: Sort the categories in descending order based on their mean target values.\nAssign numerical values: Assign numerical values to the categories based on their sorted order.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider a dataset predicting house prices, where the target variable is \"Price\" and the categorical variable is \"Neighborhood.\" We can use target guided ordinal encoding to encode the \"Neighborhood\" variable.\n\nNeighborhood\tPrice (mean)\nBeverly Hills\t$2,000,000\nBel-Air\t        $1,500,000\nBrentwood\t    $1,000,000\nWest Hollywood\t$800,000\nSanta Monica\t$700,000\n\nAfter sorting the neighborhoods based on their mean prices, we would assign the following ordinal values:\n\nNeighborhood\tOrdinal Value\nBeverly Hills\t1\nBel-Air\t        2\nBrentwood\t    3\nWest Hollywood\t4\nSanta Monica\t5\n\nWhen to use:\n\nWhen the categorical variable has a significant impact on the target variable: If the categorical variable is strongly correlated with the target, target guided ordinal encoding can capture this relationship effectively.\nWhen the categories have no inherent order: If there's no clear ordinal relationship among the categories, target guided ordinal encoding can create a meaningful order based on their predictive power.\nFor machine learning algorithms that require numerical features: Many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and gradient boosting, require numerical features.\nTarget guided ordinal encoding can transform categorical variables into numerical features suitable for these algorithms.'''",
