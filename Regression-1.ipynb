A random scatter pattern suggests linearity.\nHomoscedasticity: Look for a constant spread of residuals around the horizontal line at zero.\nNormality: Check for a normal distribution of residuals using a histogram or Q-Q plot.\n\nCorrelation matrix:\n\nMulticollinearity: Examine the correlation coefficients between independent variables.\nA high correlation between two or more variables indicates multicollinearity.\n\nStatistical tests:\n\nNormality: Use tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nHomoscedasticity: Use the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test.\n\nDiagnostic plots:\n\nCook's distance: Identify influential points that might unduly affect the regression results.\n\nAddressing Violations:\n\nIf an assumption is violated, you might need to:\n\nTransform the data: For example, log transformations can sometimes address non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.\nExclude outliers: If influential points are identified, consider removing them.\nUse alternative models: If linearity or normality assumptions are severely violated, explore non-linear regression or generalized linear models.'''",

It provides a baseline value for the dependent variable.   \n\nExample: Predicting House Prices\n\nSuppose you have a linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage. The model might look like this:\n\nPrice = Intercept + Slope * Square Footage\nSlope: If the slope is 100, it means that for every additional square foot of living space, the house price increases by $100.\nIntercept: If the intercept is $50,000, it suggests that a house with zero square footage (which doesn't exist in reality) would have a predicted price of $50,000.\nHowever, in this context, the intercept might represent a baseline price for a very small house.\n\nIn summary:\n\nSlope: The steeper the slope, the stronger the relationship between the variables. \nA positive slope indicates a positive relationship, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.\nIntercept: The intercept provides a starting point for the prediction.

The gradient indicates the direction in which the cost function increases most rapidly.\nUpdate Parameters: Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, taking a step towards the minimum. The size of the step is determined by the learning rate.\nRepeat: Continue this process until the cost function converges to a minimum or a predefined stopping criterion is met.\n\nApplications in Machine Learning\nGradient descent is a fundamental algorithm used in various machine learning tasks, including:\n\nLinear Regression: Finding the optimal coefficients for a linear regression model.\nNeural Networks: Training neural networks by adjusting the weights and biases of neurons.\nLogistic Regression: Estimating the parameters for a logistic regression model.\nSupport Vector Machines: Optimizing the hyperparameters of SVM models.\n\nTypes of Gradient Descent:\n\nBatch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient using the entire dataset in each iteration. This can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Computes the gradient using a single random data point in each iteration.

This strikes a balance between efficiency and stability.\n\nKey Considerations:\n\nLearning Rate: A small learning rate can lead to slow convergence, while a large learning rate can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum.   \nInitialization: The choice of initial parameters can affect the convergence speed and the final solution.\nRegularization: Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting by penalizing large parameter values.'''",
