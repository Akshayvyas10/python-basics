The most common aggregation method is voting, where the class with the most votes from the individual models is chosen as the final prediction.\n\nAdvantages of bagging:\n\nReduced overfitting: By creating multiple models from different bootstrap samples, bagging can help to reduce overfitting.\nImproved accuracy: In many cases, bagging can improve the accuracy of a model compared to using a single model.\nParallel processing: The training of individual models can be parallelized, making bagging computationally efficient.\n\nCommon bagging algorithms:\n\nRandom Forest: An ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample and a random subset of features.\nBagged Regression Trees: A bagging ensemble of regression trees.\nBagging is a versatile technique that can be applied to a variety of machine learning algorithms. \nIt is particularly effective for models that are prone to overfitting, such as decision trees.'''",
