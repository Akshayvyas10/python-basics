OLS does not have a penalty term.   \n\nBias-Variance Trade-off: Ridge Regression introduces bias by shrinking the coefficients, but it often reduces variance,\nleading to improved generalization performance. OLS is unbiased but can suffer from high variance, especially in the presence of multicollinearity.   \n\nFeature Selection: Ridge Regression does not perform feature selection by setting coefficients to zero. Instead, \nit shrinks all coefficients towards zero. OLS can select features by setting coefficients to zero if they are not significant.   \n\nWhen to Use Ridge Regression:\nMulticollinearity: When independent variables are highly correlated.   \nOverfitting: When the model is overly complex and fits the training data too closely.   \nImproved Generalization: When you want to improve the model's performance on new data.'''",
