    "In simpler terms, it's a messenger that allows two applications to talk to each other.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. The menu lists all the dishes you can order (the API's functions).\n",
    "When you place an order, you're making a request (an API call), and the kitchen (the system) prepares your food (processes the request) and serves it to you (returns the result).   \n",

    "A weather app on your phone uses a weather API to get real-time weather data.\n",
    "When you open the app, it sends a request to a weather service's API (like OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com). \n",
    "This API receives the request, fetches the current weather data for your location, and sends it back to the app. The app then displays the weather information on your screen.   \n",

    "In essence, an API acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to share data and functionality.'''   \n",
