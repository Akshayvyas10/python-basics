This means that the non-zero coefficients represent the most important features in the model.   \nShrunken Coefficients: The coefficients in Lasso Regression are often smaller than those in OLS, due to the regularization penalty. This can make it easier to interpret the relative importance of different features.   \nNo Direct Causal Interpretation: As with any statistical model, the coefficients in Lasso Regression do not necessarily imply a causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Correlation does not imply causation.   \n\nHere are some specific points to consider when interpreting Lasso Regression coefficients:\n\nNon-Zero Coefficients: The features with non-zero coefficients are considered the most important predictors in the model.\nMagnitude: The magnitude of the coefficients can provide insights into the relative importance of the features. Larger coefficients generally indicate a stronger relationship with the dependent variable.\nSign: The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship. A positive coefficient suggests a positive relationship, while a negative coefficient suggests a negative relationship.   \nStatistical Significance: While Lasso Regression does not directly provide p-values for the coefficients, you can use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to assess their statistical significance.'''",
