It's often used for continuous numerical data.\nManhattan Distance: Measures the distance between two points along the axes of a coordinate system. It's also known as the \"city block distance\" or \"L1 distance.\" It's often used for data where the direction of movement is restricted to axes, like grid-based problems.\n\nImpact on KNN Performance:\nThe choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in several ways:\n\nData Characteristics: If the data is naturally clustered in a Euclidean space, Euclidean distance might be more appropriate. If the data is more structured along axes (like a grid), Manhattan distance might be better.\nOutlier Sensitivity: Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than Manhattan distance. Outliers can have a larger impact on the straight-line distance, potentially affecting the KNN's predictions.\nFeature Scaling: The choice of distance metric can interact with feature scaling. If features are not scaled properly, one metric might dominate over the other. '''",

Different distance metrics measure similarity between data points in different ways, and the appropriate choice depends on the characteristics of your data.\n\nHere are some common distance metrics and their characteristics:\n\nEuclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It's suitable for continuous numerical data.\nManhattan Distance: Measures the distance between two points along the axes of a coordinate system. It's useful for data where the direction of movement is restricted to axes, like grid-based problems.\nMinkowski Distance: A generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances. It's a parameterizable distance metric that can be adjusted to different values of p. For p=1, it's equivalent to Manhattan distance, and for p=2, it's equivalent to Euclidean distance.\nHamming Distance: Measures the number of positions at which two strings differ. It's suitable for categorical or binary data.\nCosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It's useful for comparing the orientation of vectors, such as in text analysis or document similarity.\n\nChoosing the right distance metric:\n\nData Type: Consider the type of data you're working with. Euclidean distance is suitable for continuous numerical data, while Manhattan distance and Hamming distance are more appropriate for categorical or binary data.\nFeature Scaling: If your features have different scales, feature scaling can help ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.\nOutlier Sensitivity: Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than Manhattan distance. If your data contains outliers, Manhattan distance might be a better choice.\nDomain Knowledge: If you have domain knowledge about the problem, you can use that to inform your choice of distance metric.
