    "'''MongoDB: A NoSQL Database\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database that uses a document-oriented data model. \n",
    "It stores data in flexible, JSON-like structures called documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases\n",
    "Unlike relational databases (SQL), non-relational databases don't rely on a fixed schema. \n",
    "They offer flexibility in data storage and retrieval, making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: Data structure can evolve over time.\n",
    "Scalability: Can handle massive amounts of data.\n",
    "High performance: Often optimized for speed and handling large datasets.\n",
    "Flexibility: Can store various data types within a single document.\n",
    "When to Choose MongoDB Over SQL\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data: MongoDB excels at storing and querying data that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns.\n",
    "High-performance applications: MongoDB's flexible schema and indexing capabilities can lead to faster query performance.\n",
    "Rapid development: The schema-less nature of MongoDB allows for agile development and faster time-to-market.\n",
    "Real-time analytics: MongoDB's ability to handle large datasets efficiently makes it suitable for real-time analytics applications.\n",
    "Horizontal scaling: MongoDB can easily scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes and traffic.\n",
    "Examples of use cases:\n",

    "Content management systems\n",
    "Mobile applications\n",
