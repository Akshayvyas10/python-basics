Larger coefficients generally indicate a stronger relationship with the dependent variable.\nSign: The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship. A positive coefficient suggests a positive relationship, while a negative coefficient suggests a negative relationship.   \nStatistical Significance: While Elastic Net does not directly provide p-values for the coefficients, you can use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to assess their statistical significance.\n\nHowever, interpreting the coefficients in Elastic Net can be more challenging than in Ridge or Lasso Regression, especially when\nboth L1 and L2 penalties are active.

This allows the model to learn to handle missing data.\nChoosing the best method depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.\nFor example, if you have a large dataset with many missing values, imputation might be preferable to deletion. \nIf you suspect that missing values are informative, creating new features to indicate missingness can be helpful.\n\nIt's important to note that handling missing values can have a significant impact on the performance of your Elastic Net Regression model.'''",
