Hierarchical Clustering:\nGoal: Create a hierarchy of clusters, starting from individual data points and merging them into larger clusters.\nApproach: Based on distance or similarity measures between clusters.\nExamples: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Divisive Hierarchical Clustering\n\nAgglomerative Hierarchical Clustering:\nApproach: Starts with each data point as a separate cluster and merges the closest pair of clusters iteratively until a single cluster remains.\n\nDivisive Hierarchical Clustering:\nApproach: Starts with a single cluster containing all data points and recursively divides the cluster into smaller clusters until a desired number of clusters is reached.   \n\n3. Density-Based Clustering:\nGoal: Identify clusters based on regions of high density in the data.\nApproach: Based on density measures and distance between data points.\nExamples: DBSCAN, OPTICS\n\nDBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\nAssumption: Clusters are defined as regions of high density surrounded by regions of low density.\nApproach: Identifies core points, border points, and noise points based on density parameters.\n\nOPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure):\nApproach: Orders data points based on their core reachability distance, allowing for varying densities and identifying clusters of different sizes.",

A higher value indicates better-defined clusters.\n\nGap Statistic:\nCompare the variance explained by the clustering model to the variance explained by a reference distribution (e.g., uniform distribution).\nThe gap statistic measures the difference between these two variances. A larger gap statistic indicates a better clustering solution.\n\nDomain Knowledge:\nIf you have domain knowledge about the data, you can use that to inform your choice of K.
