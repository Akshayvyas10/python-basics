This structure allows for a visual representation of how clusters merge or split at different levels.\nAgglomerative or Divisive: Hierarchical clustering can be either agglomerative or divisive:\nAgglomerative: Starts with each data point as a separate cluster and merges the closest pairs of clusters iteratively until a single cluster remains.\nDivisive: Starts with a single cluster containing all data points and recursively divides the cluster into smaller clusters until a desired number of clusters is reached.   \nNo Predefined Number of Clusters: Hierarchical clustering doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. The dendrogram provides a way to visualize and choose the appropriate number of clusters based on the desired level of granularity.\n\nKey differences from other clustering techniques:\n\nPartitioning Clustering (e.g., K-means): Hierarchical clustering doesn't require specifying the number of clusters upfront, while K-means does. Hierarchical clustering also creates a hierarchical structure, whereas K-means assigns data points to discrete clusters.\nDensity-Based Clustering (e.g., DBSCAN): Hierarchical clustering focuses on the relationships between data points based on distance or similarity, while density-based clustering focuses on identifying regions of high density in the data.'''",
