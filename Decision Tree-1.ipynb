This feature is chosen based on a criterion like information gain, Gini impurity, or entropy.\nSplitting: The dataset is divided into subsets based on the values of the selected feature.\nRecursive Process: The same process is recursively applied to each subset, creating new nodes and branches in the tree until a stopping criterion is met.\nLeaf Nodes: The final nodes of the tree are called leaf nodes, and they represent the predicted class or value.\n\nDecision Making:\nTo make a prediction for a new instance, the instance is passed down the tree, starting from the root node.\nAt each node, the instance's value for the corresponding feature is compared to the decision threshold.\nBased on the comparison, the instance is directed to the left or right child node. \nThis process continues until a leaf node is reached, which represents the predicted class or value.\n\nStopping Criteria:\nMaximum depth: The tree stops growing when it reaches a specified maximum depth.\nMinimum number of samples: A node stops splitting if it contains fewer than a specified number of samples.\nMinimum impurity: A node stops splitting if its impurity (e.g., Gini impurity) falls below a threshold.\n\nAdvantages of Decision Trees:\nEasy to understand: Decision trees are intuitive and can be visualized, making them easy to interpret.\nHandles both categorical and numerical data: Decision trees can handle mixed data types.\nNon-parametric: Decision trees do not make assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\nRobust to outliers: Decision trees are relatively insensitive to outliers.\n\nDisadvantages of Decision Trees:\nOverfitting: Decision trees can overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization performance.\nSensitive to small changes in data: Small changes in the data can lead to significant changes in the tree structure.\nProne to bias: Decision trees can be biased towards features with many levels.'''",

Entropy measures the uncertainty or impurity in a dataset.\nThe goal of a decision tree is to reduce this entropy by splitting the data into subsets that are more homogeneous.\n\nInformation Entropy\nDefinition: Entropy is a measure of the randomness or uncertainty in a dataset.\nFormula: For a dataset with classes C1, C2, ..., Cn and their corresponding probabilities p1, p2, ..., pn, the entropy is calculated as:\nEntropy(S) = -∑(pi * log2(pi))\nwhere S is the dataset.\n\nInformation Gain\nDefinition: Information gain is the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting a dataset.\nCalculation: The information gain of a feature A is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the parent node S and the weighted average entropy of the child nodes S_v after splitting on A.\nInformationGain(S, A) = Entropy(S) - ∑((|Sv| / |S|) * Entropy(Sv))\nwhere |Sv| is the size of the subset Sv and |S| is the size of the parent node S.\n\nDecision Tree Construction\nChoose the root node: Select the feature with the highest information gain as the root node.\nSplit the dataset: Divide the dataset into subsets based on the values of the root node feature.\nRepeat: Recursively apply the same process to each subset, choosing the best feature to split on at each level.\nStop: The process continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples, or minimum impurity).\n\nMaking Predictions\nTo make a prediction for a new instance, it is passed through the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node. \nThe class label associated with the leaf node is the predicted class.\n\nIn essence, decision trees aim to find the optimal sequence of splits that minimize the entropy of the resulting subsets, \nleading to more accurate predictions.'''",
