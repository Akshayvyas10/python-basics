However, I can outline the general process.\n\nCalculating Pearson Correlation Coefficient\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is calculated using the following formula:\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere:\nxi and yi are individual data points for study time and final exam scores, respectively.\nx̄ and ȳ are the means of study time and final exam scores, respectively.\n\nInterpreting the Result\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:\nr = 1: Perfect positive correlation, indicating a strong direct relationship between the two variables.\nr = -1: Perfect negative correlation, indicating a strong inverse relationship between the two variables.\nr = 0: No correlation, indicating no linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nExample:\nIf you calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between study time and final exam scores and obtain a value of 0.8, \nthis would indicate a strong positive correlation.
