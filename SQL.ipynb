    "Relational: Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.   \n",
    "Structured: Follows a predefined schema, defining data types and relationships.   \n",

    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server   \n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases\n",

    "Non-relational: Data is stored in various models like key-value, document, graph, or wide-column.   \n",
