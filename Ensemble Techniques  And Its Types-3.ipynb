This helps to reduce overfitting.\nFeature Bagging: Each tree is also trained on a random subset of features, further increasing diversity and reducing correlation between trees.\nAveraging Predictions: The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the decision trees in the forest.\n\nHow it works:\n\nCreate Multiple Trees: Generate a specified number of decision trees.\nBootstrap Sampling: For each tree, randomly select a subset of the training data with replacement.\nFeature Bagging: For each tree, randomly select a subset of features to use for splitting.\nTrain Trees: Train each decision tree on its respective subset of data.\nMake Predictions: For a new data point, each tree makes a prediction.\nAverage Predictions: The final prediction is the average of all tree predictions.\n\nAdvantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n\nHandles large datasets: Can handle a large number of features and instances.\nReduces overfitting: Bootstrap sampling and feature bagging help prevent overfitting.\nHandles missing values: Can handle missing data without imputation.\nInterpretable: The importance of each feature can be assessed.\n\nDisadvantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n\nComputational cost: Can be computationally expensive for large datasets and a large number of trees.\nLess interpretable than individual decision trees: The ensemble nature makes it harder to understand the exact decision-making process.

This reduces the likelihood that the model will fit the training data too closely and generalize poorly to new data.\nAveraging Predictions: The final prediction is an average of the predictions from all trees. This helps to smooth out the effects of individual trees that might overfit, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.\n\nFeature Bagging:\n\nRandom Feature Subsets: Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of features. This prevents any single feature from dominating the model, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific patterns in the data.\nDiversity: The use of different feature subsets for each tree further increases the diversity of the ensemble, making it less likely to overfit.\nThese two mechanisms work together to create a more robust and generalizable model, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's performance on unseen data.
