This reduces the likelihood that the model will fit the training data too closely and generalize poorly to new data.\nAveraging Predictions: The final prediction is an average of the predictions from all trees. This helps to smooth out the effects of individual trees that might overfit, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.\n\nFeature Bagging:\n\nRandom Feature Subsets: Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of features. This prevents any single feature from dominating the model, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific patterns in the data.\nDiversity: The use of different feature subsets for each tree further increases the diversity of the ensemble, making it less likely to overfit.\nThese two mechanisms work together to create a more robust and generalizable model, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's performance on unseen data.
